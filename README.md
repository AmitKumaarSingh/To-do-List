What is To-do list?
The definition is a simple one. It’s a list of tasks you need to complete or things that you want to do.
Most typically, they’re organised in order of priority. Traditionally, they’re written on a piece of paper or post it notes and act as a memory aid. As technology has evolved, we have been able to create a to-do lists with excel spreadsheets, word documents, email lists, to-do list apps, Microsoft to do and google to do list to name a few. You can use a to do list in your home and personal life, or in the workplace.

Having a list of everything you need to do written down in one place means you shouldn’t forget anything important. By prioritising the tasks in the list, you plan the order in which you’re going to do them and can quickly see what needs your immediate attention and what tasks you can leave until a little later.





Layout
Layout For different web views - Different layouts means that how our webpage will open on different devices i.e., Tablets, mobiles, desktops.

WebView:
When someone will open our page from computers, it will look like this.
 
After clicking on button “b1” it will ask for user sign in or sign up.
So, there will be 2 input fields and 1 button, it will appear for sign-up or sign-in.

 

After submit, new page will open and that is homepage and, on that page, it will show 3 buttons.
I.	Add to-do list.
II.	View to-do list.
III.	Remove to-do list.
 

Add to-do list- when user click on this button, then pop-up will come and ask to insert data like meetings, lunch, exercise. After writing data it also must ask for date and time for remind me purpose.
View to-do list- When user click on this button, here it will show existing data or to-do.
Remove to-do list- When user click on this button then first data should appear after that we will delete data 1 by 1.

•	We will give some effects on button like when we move our mouse on button it will change colour.

Mobile View- When user open this website in small devices such as mobile it should open according to its width or size.

Here we will give 1 button with text “get started”. And when user clicks on it, it should ask for sign-in or sign-up.
 

After click on button, it should ask for username and password in input field on same page.

 

And when we logged in after that again there should be 3 buttons.
I.	Add to-do list.
II.	View to-do list.
III.	Remove to-do list.

 

Languages
Which languages we will need?
HTML – For creating websites.
CSS – We will give style to HTML elements.
JavaScript -it will help to interact with our website and gives a dynamic look.

Responsiveness-
We will use flexbox or fluid-grid for responsiveness it will help with when user use this website in different devices so it will fit in every device screen.
We will also use vw, vh, rem, for responsive website because if we use pixels, it will not change its size according to device width and height.
For e.g. We will use this type of code for responsiveness.
“@media (min-width: 640px) {body {font-size:1rem;} }
@media (min-width:960px) {body {font-size:1.2rem;} }
@media (min-width:1100px) {body {font-size:1.5rem;} }”

We will use different divisions to work on same page so we can use inline tags.
Here we will change font size, font family, font-colour, background colour or we will put background image. 

We will use form so here we can give some effects also like when user click on buttons some transition will happen.
Give some different background behind form.
